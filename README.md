# Influenza_Season_Analysis
Data analysis of seasonal and regional trends of flue season in the U.S. using Excel and Tableau
# Objective
To assist the medical staffing agencies with the preparation plan for the upcoming influenza season. The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States.
# Data
Open source data. Source: CDC and US Census Bureau
- Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender
- Population data by geography
- Influenza lab test results by state
# Tools
Excel, Tableau
# Insights & Recommendations

People over 65 years are at higher risk of developing flu complications and being admitted to the hospital than other age groups.
- The state with the high rate of aging population will need additional medical staff.
 
The next flu season will highly likely begin in December with the highest flu rates in January. The level of flu cases is probably to remain high in February and March. 
- We anticipate that hospitals will have a critical need for additional medical personnel from December to March.

Using influenza mortality rates as an indicator of influenza severity, U.S. states are classified as having high, medium, and low health care needs. 
- We recommend developing a staffing plan that prioritizes the allocation of additional health care personnel to states with higher potential influenza mortality rates and high rates of population aging. 
- Five states should be given high priority: California, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas. 
- The following states classified as having medium health care needs will also require additional medical staff: Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan, Tennessee and Massachusetts.
- The other states are at low risk for developing influenza complications.
# Key takeaway
- It is important to consider data limitations. It allows us to understand the data incompleteness or data inaccuracy and then to determine if the data is relevant for the purpose of analysis and how we can handle the issue with data accuracy.
- Data mapping helps to match the variable and to understand how to transform them to integrate two data sets into one.
- Excel formulas and Tableau visualization allow us to conduct descriptive and statistical analysis. The important step of the analysis is the interpretation of statistical coefficients.
- Tableau is a powerful tool that we can use for analysis and to create a story board for project presentation.
